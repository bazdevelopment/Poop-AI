## 👨🏼‍🔧 Troubleshooting

-implementation for expo-blur to have the same behavior as react-native-community/blur library
-keep in mind blur on android is experimental and it can cause some issues/crashes

<!-- <BlurView
intensity={100}
experimentalBlurMethod="dimezisBlurView" //!important for android
tint="dark"
style={[StyleSheet.absoluteFill]}
/> -->
